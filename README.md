# Red-whiskered Bulbul aka Beta!
## Overview

This is a personal website where i designed to celebrate the Red-whiskered Bulbul (Pycnonotus jocosus) that has been nesting in the owner's home since 2022. It's a combinaiton of personal storytelling with some content about the bird species, some  multimedia galleries with photos, videos, and audio recordings. I have also added tamil version for my mom.



## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- **Rationale**: No build process or framework overhead; simple static site suitable for GitHub Pages deployment
- **Pros**: Fast loading, easy to maintain, works everywhere, no dependencies
- **Cons**: Manual DOM manipulation, limited scalability for complex features


- **Visual Design**: Bold, modern black-red-white color scheme with clean aesthetics 
- **Background Effects**: Fixed radial gradients create subtle wave patterns with smooth animations

### Media Management
- **Rationale**: Simple folder structure suitable for static hosting; no CDN or database needed

**Video Playback Control**: JavaScript ensures only one video plays at a time
- **Implementation**: Event listeners pause other videos when one starts playing
- **Rationale**: Prevents audio overlap and improves user experience


### kept it simple
- No external JavaScript libraries
- No CSS frameworks
- No backend services
- No databases
- No build tools or bundlers
- No third-party hosting for media assets
